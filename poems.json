pale.","O'er field and fence he scours, and furrows wide,","With wakened Comrade barking by his side;","Whilst tracks of trodden grain, and sidelong hay,","And broken hedge-flowers sweet, mark his

Southey","poem":["The summer and autumn had been so wet,","That in winter the corn was growing yet,","'Twas a piteous sight to see all around","The grain lie rotting on the ground.","Every day the starving poor","Crowded around Bishop Hatto's door,","For he had a plentiful last-year's store,","And all the neighbourhood could tell","His granaries were furnish'd well.","At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day","To quiet the poor without delay;","He bade them to his great Barn repair,","And they should have food for the winter there.","Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,","The poor folk flock'd from far and near;","The great barn was full as it could hold","Of women and children, and young and old.","Then when he saw it could hold no more,","Bishop Hatto he made fast the door;","And while for mercy on Christ they call,","He set fire to the Barn and burnt them all.","\"I'faith 'tis an excellent bonfire!\" quoth he,","\"And the country is greatly obliged to me,","For ridding it in these times forlorn","Of Rats that only consume the corn.\"","So then to his palace returned he,","And he sat down to supper merrily,","And he slept that night like an innocent man;","But Bishop Hatto never slept again.","In the morning as he enter'd the hall","Where his picture hung against the wall,","A sweat like death all over him came,","For the Rats had eaten it out of the frame.","As he look'd there came a man from his farm-","He had a countenance white with alarm;","\"My Lord, I open'd your granaries this morn,","And the Rats had eaten all your corn.\"","Another came running presently,","And he was pale as pale could be,","\"Fly! my Lord Bishop, fly,\" quoth he,","\"Ten thousand Rats are coming this way,...","The Lord forgive you for yesterday!\"","\"I'll go to my tower on the Rhine,\" replied he,","\"'Tis the safest place in Germany;","The walls are high and the shores are steep,","And the stream is strong and the water deep.\"","Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd away,","And he crost the Rhine without delay,","And reach'd his tower, and barr'd with care","All the windows, doors, and loop-holes there.","He laid him down and closed his eyes;...","But soon a scream made him arise,","He started and saw two eyes of flame","On his pillow from whence the screaming came.","He listen'd and look'd;... it was only the Cat;","And the Bishop he grew more fearful for that,","For she sat screaming, mad with fear","At the Army of Rats that were drawing near.","For they have swum over the river so deep,","And they have climb'd the shores so steep,","And up the Tower their way is bent,","To do the work for which they were sent.","They are not to be told by the dozen or score,","By thousands they come, and by myriads and more,","Such numbers had never been heard of before,","Such a judgment had never been witness'd of yore.","Down on his knees the Bishop fell,","And faster and faster his beads did he tell,","As louder and louder drawing near","The gnawing of their teeth he could hear.","And in at the windows and in at the door,","And through the walls helter-skelter they pour,","And down from the ceiling and up through the floor,","From the right and the left, from behind and before,","From within and without, from above and below,","And all at once to the Bishop they go.","They have whetted their teeth against the stones,","And now they pick the Bishop's bones:","They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb,","For they were sent to do judgment on him!"]},"6603bde23bab74abfcd748077833cc64":{"url":"www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50601/to-the-poor","title":"To the Poor","author":"Anna Laetitia Barbauld","poem":["Child of distress, who meet'st the

hearts","Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light:","And they did live by watchfires-and the thrones,","The palaces of crowned kings-the huts,","The habitations of all things which dwell,","Were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd,","And men were gather'd round their blazing homes","To look once more into each other's face;","Happy were those who dwelt within the eye","Of the volcanos,

plain.","The rocky summits, split and rent,","Formed turret, dome, or battlement,","Or seemed fantastically set","With cupola or minaret,","Wild crests as pagod ever decked,","Or mosque of Eastern architect.","Nor were these earth-born castles bare,","Nor lacked they many a banner fair;","For, from their shivered brows displayed,","Far o'er the unfathomable glade,","All twinkling with the dewdrop sheen,","The brier-rose fell in streamers green,","And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes,","Waved in the west-wind's summer sighs.","Boon nature scattered, free and wild,","Each plant or flower, the mountain's child.","Here eglantine embalmed the air,","Hawthorn and hazel mingled there;","The primrose pale, and violet flower,","Found in each cliff a narrow bower;","Fox-glove and night-shade, side by side,","Emblems of punishment and pride,","Grouped their dark hues with every stain","The weather-beaten crags retain.","With boughs that quaked at every breath,","Gray birch and aspen wept beneath;","Aloft, the ash and warrior oak","Cast anchor in the rifted rock;","And, higher yet, the pine-tree hung","His shattered trunk, and frequent flung,","Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high,","His boughs athwart the narrowed sky.","Highest of all, where white peaks glanced,","Where glist'ning streamers waved and danced,","The wanderer's eye could barely view","The summer heaven's delicious blue;","So wondrous wild, the whole might seem","The scenery of a fairy dream.","Onward, amid the copse 'gan peep","A narrow inlet, still and deep,","Affording scarce such breadth of brim","As served the wild duck's brood to swim.","Lost for a space, through thickets veering,","But broader when again appearing,","Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face","Could on the dark-blue mirror trace;","And farther as the hunter strayed,","Still broader sweep its channels made.","The shaggy mounds no longer stood,","Emerging from entangled wood,","But, wave-encircled, seemed to float,","Like castle girdled with its moat;","Yet broader floods extending still","Divide them from their parent hill,","Till each, retiring, claims to be","An islet in an inland sea.","And now, to issue from the glen,","No pathway meets the wanderer's ken,","Unless he climb, with footing nice","A far projecting precipice.","The broom's tough roots his ladder made,","The hazel saplings lent their aid;","And thus an airy point he won,","Where, gleaming with the setting sun,","One burnished sheet of living gold,","Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled,","In all her length far winding lay,","With promontory, creek, and bay,","And islands that, empurpled bright,","Floated amid the livelier light,","And mountains, that like giants stand,","To sentinel enchanted land.","High on the south, huge Benvenue","Down to the lake in masses threw","Crags, knolls, and mountains, confusedly hurled,","The fragments of an earlier world;","A wildering forest feathered o'er","His ruined sides and summit hoar,","While on the north, through middle air,","Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare."]},"7c32af0df16e7c3e800fb4515da79c06":{"url":"www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51926/loving-and-liking-irregular-verses-addressed-to-a-child","title":"Loving and Liking: Irregular Verses Addressed

'tis given to me.'","Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side,","And raised to heaven her eyes so blue-","Alas! said she, this ghastly ride-","Dear lady! it hath wildered you!","The lady wiped her moist cold brow,","And faintly said, ' 'tis over now!'","Again the wild-flower wine she drank:","Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,","And from the floor whereon she sank,","The lofty lady stood upright:","She was most beautiful to see,","Like a lady of a far countree.","And thus the lofty lady spake-","'All they who live in the upper sky,","Do love you, holy Christabel!","And you love them, and for their sake","And for the good which me befel,","Even I in my degree will try,","Fair maiden, to requite you well.","But now unrobe yourself; for I","Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie.'","Quoth Christabel, So let it be!","And as the lady bade, did she.","Her gentle limbs did she undress,","And lay down in her loveliness.","But through her brain of weal and woe","So many thoughts moved to and fro,","That vain it were her lids to close;","So half-way from the bed she rose,","And on her elbow did recline","To look at the lady Geraldine.","Beneath the lamp the lady bowed,","And slowly rolled her eyes around;","Then drawing in her breath aloud,","Like one that shuddered, she unbound","The cincture from beneath her breast:","Her silken robe, and inner vest,","Dropt to her feet, and full in view,","Behold! her bosom and half her side-","A sight to dream of, not to tell!","O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!","Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;","Ah! what a stricken look was hers!","Deep from within she seems half-way","To lift some weight with sick assay,","And eyes the maid and seeks delay;","Then suddenly, as one defied,","Collects herself in scorn and pride,","And lay down by the Maiden's side!-","And in her arms the maid she took,","Ah wel-a-day!","And with low voice and doleful look","These words did say:","'In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,","Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!","Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,","This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;","But vainly thou warrest,","For this is alone in","Thy power to declare,","That in the dim forest","Thou heard'st a low moaning,","And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair;","And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,","To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.'","THE CONCLUSION TO PART I","It was a lovely sight to see","The lady Christabel, when she","Was praying at the old oak tree.","Amid the jagged shadows","Of mossy leafless boughs,","Kneeling in the moonlight,","To make her gentle vows;","Her slender palms together prest,","Heaving sometimes on her breast;","Her face resigned to bliss or bale-","Her face, oh call it fair not pale,","And both blue eyes more bright than clear,","Each about to have a tear.","With open eyes (ah woe is me!)","Asleep, and dreaming fearfully,","Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis,","Dreaming that alone, which is-","O sorrow and shame! Can this be she,","The lady, who knelt at the old oak tree?","And lo! the worker of these harms,","That holds the maiden in her arms,","Seems to slumber still and mild,","As a mother with her child.","A star hath set, a star hath risen,","O Geraldine! since arms of thine","Have been the lovely lady's prison.","O Geraldine! one hour was thine-","Thou'st had thy will!

they had been friends in youth;","But whispering tongues can poison truth;","And constancy lives in realms above;","And life is thorny; and youth is vain;","And to be wroth with one we love","Doth work like madness in the brain.","And thus it chanced, as I divine,","With Roland and Sir Leoline.","Each spake words of high disdain","And insult to his heart's best brother:","They parted-ne'er to meet again!","But never either found another","To free the hollow heart from paining-","They stood aloof, the scars remaining,","Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;","A dreary sea now flows between;-","But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,","Shall wholly do away, I ween,","The marks of that which once hath been.","Sir Leoline, a moment's space,","Stood gazing on the damsel's face:","And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine","Came back upon his heart again.","O then the Baron forgot his age,","His noble heart swelled high with rage;","He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side","He would proclaim it far and wide,","With trump and solemn heraldry,","That they, who thus had wronged the dame,","Were base as spotted infamy!","'And if they dare deny the same,","My herald shall appoint a week,","And let the recreant traitors seek","My tourney court-that there and then","I may dislodge their reptile souls","From the bodies and forms of men!'","He spake: his eye in lightning rolls!","For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned","In the beautiful lady the child of his friend!","And now the tears were on his face,","And fondly in his arms he took","Fair Geraldine, who met the embrace,","Prolonging it with joyous look.","Which when she viewed, a vision fell","Upon the soul of Christabel,","The vision of fear, the touch and pain!","She shrunk and shuddered, and saw again-","(Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee,","Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?)","Again she saw that bosom old,","Again she felt that bosom cold,","And drew in her breath with a hissing sound:","Whereat the Knight turned wildly round,","And nothing saw, but his own sweet maid","With eyes upraised, as one that prayed.","The touch, the sight, had passed away,","And in its stead that vision blest,","Which comforted her after-rest","While in the lady's arms she lay,","Had put a rapture in her breast,","And on her lips and o'er her eyes","Spread smiles like light!","With new surprise,","'What ails then my beloved child?","The Baron said-His daughter mild","Made answer, 'All will yet be well!'","I ween, she had no power to tell","Aught else: so mighty was the spell.","Yet he, who saw this Geraldine,","Had deemed her sure a thing divine:","Such sorrow with such grace she blended,","As if she feared she had offended","Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid!","And with such lowly tones she prayed","She might be sent without delay","Home to her father's mansion.","'Nay!","Nay, by my soul!' said Leoline.","'Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!","Go thou, with sweet music and loud,","And take two steeds with trappings proud,","And take the youth whom thou lov'st best","To bear thy harp, and learn thy song,","And clothe you both in solemn vest,","And over the mountains haste along,","Lest wandering folk, that are abroad,","Detain you on the valley road.","'And when he has crossed the Irthing flood,","My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes","Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood,","And reaches soon that castle good","Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.","'Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,","Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,","More loud than your horses' echoing feet!","And loud and loud to Lord Roland call,","Thy daughter is safe in Langdale hall!","Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free-","Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me!","He bids thee come without delay","With all thy numerous array","And take thy lovely daughter home:","And he will meet thee on the way","With all his numerous array","White with their panting palfreys' foam:","And, by mine honour! I will say,","That I repent me of the day","When I spake words of fierce disdain","To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!-","-For since that evil hour hath flown,","Many a summer's sun hath shone;","Yet ne'er found I a friend again","Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine.","The lady fell, and clasped his knees,","Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;","And Bracy replied, with faltering voice,","His gracious Hail on all bestowing!-","'Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,","Are sweeter than my harp can tell;","Yet might I gain a boon of thee,","This day my journey should not be,","So strange a dream hath come to me,","That I had vowed with music loud","To clear yon wood from thing unblest.","Warned by a vision in my rest!","For in my sleep I saw that dove,","That gentle bird, whom thou dost love,","And call'st by thy own daughter's name-","Sir Leoline! I saw the same","Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan,","Among the green herbs in the forest alone.","Which when I saw and when I heard,","I wonder'd what might ail the bird;","For nothing near it could I see","Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree.","'And in my dream methought I went","To search out what might there be found;","And what the sweet bird's trouble meant,","That thus lay fluttering on the ground.","I went and peered, and could descry","No cause for her distressful cry;","But yet for her dear lady's sake","I stooped, methought, the dove to take,","When lo! I saw a bright green snake","Coiled around its wings and neck.","Green as the herbs on which it couched,","Close by the dove's its head it crouched;","And with the dove it heaves and stirs,","Swelling its neck as she swelled hers!","I woke; it was the midnight hour,","The clock was echoing in the tower;","But though my slumber was gone by,","This dream it would not pass away-","It seems to live upon my eye!","And thence I vowed this self-same day","With music strong and saintly song","To wander through the forest bare,","Lest aught unholy loiter there.'","Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while,","Half-listening heard him with a smile;","Then turned to Lady Geraldine,","His eyes made up of wonder and love;","And said in courtly accents fine,","'Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove,","With arms more strong than harp or song,","Thy sire and I will crush the snake!'","He kissed her forehead as he spake,","And Geraldine in maiden wise","Casting down her large bright eyes,","With blushing cheek and courtesy fine","She turned her from Sir Leoline;","Softly gathering up her train,","That o'er her right arm fell again;","And folded her arms across her chest,","And couched her head upon her breast,","And looked askance at Christabel","Jesu, Maria, shield her well!","A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy;","And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,","Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye","And with somewhat of malice, and more of dread,","At Christabel she looked askance!-","One moment-and the sight was fled!","But Christabel in dizzy trance","Stumbling on the unsteady ground","Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound;","And Geraldine again turned round,","And like a thing, that sought relief,","Full of wonder and full of grief,","She rolled her large bright eyes divine","Wildly on Sir Leoline.","The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,","She nothing sees-no sight but one!","The maid, devoid of guile and sin,","I know not how, in fearful wise,","So deeply she had drunken in","That look, those shrunken serpent eyes,","That all her features were resigned","To this sole image in her mind:","And passively did imitate","That look of dull and treacherous hate!","And thus she stood, in dizzy trance;","Still picturing that look askance","With forced unconscious sympathy","Full before her father's view-","As far as such a look could be","In eyes so innocent and blue!","And when the trance was o'er, the maid","Paused awhile, and inly prayed:","Then falling at the Baron's feet,","'By my mother's soul do I entreat","That thou this woman send away!'","She said: and more she could not say:","For what she knew she could not tell,","O'er-mastered by the mighty spell.","Why is thy cheek so wan and wild,","Sir Leoline? Thy only child","Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride,","So fair, so innocent, so mild;","The same, for whom thy lady died!","O by the pangs of her dear mother","Think thou no evil of thy child!","For her, and thee, and for no other,","She prayed the moment ere she died:","Prayed that the babe for whom she died,","Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride!","That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,","Sir Leoline!","And wouldst thou wrong thy only child,","Her child and thine?","Within the Baron's heart and brain","If thoughts, like these, had any share,","They only swelled his rage and pain,","And did but work confusion there.","His heart was cleft with pain and rage,","His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild,","Dishonoured thus in his old age;","Dishonoured by his only child,","And all his hospitality","To the wronged daughter of his friend","By more than woman's jealousy","Brought thus to a disgraceful end-","He rolled his eye with stern regard","Upon the gentle minstrel bard,","And said in tones abrupt, austere-","'Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?","I bade thee hence!' The bard obeyed;","And turning from his own sweet maid,","The aged knight, Sir Leoline,","Led forth the lady Geraldine!","THE CONCLUSION TO PART II","A little child, a limber elf,","Singing, dancing to itself,","A fairy thing with red round cheeks,","That always finds, and never seeks,","Makes such a vision to the sight","As fills a father's eyes with light;","And pleasures flow in so thick and fast","Upon his heart, that he at last","Must needs express his love's excess","With words of unmeant bitterness.","Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together","Thoughts so all unlike each other;","To mutter and mock a broken charm,","To dally with wrong that does no harm.","Perhaps 'tis tender too and pretty","At each wild word to feel within","A sweet recoil of love and pity.","And what, if in a world of sin","(O sorrow and shame should this be true!)","Such giddiness of heart and brain","Comes seldom save from rage and pain,","So talks as it 's most used to do."]},"3b0c886cc0630c62c1a6b8cd9d992554":{"url":"www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43826/dear-doctor-i-have-read-your-play","title":"Dear Doctor, I have Read your Play","author":"Lord Byron (George Gordon)","poem":["Dear Doctor, I have read your play,","Which is a good one in its way,","Purges the eyes, and moves the bowels,","And drenches handkerchiefs like towels","With tears that, in a flux of grief,","Afford hysterical relief","To shatter'd nerves and quicken'd pulses,","Which your catastrophe convulses.","I like your moral and machinery;","Your plot, too, has such scope for scenery!","Your dialogue is apt and smart;","The play's concoction full of art;","Your hero raves, your heroine cries,","All stab, and everybody dies;","In short, your tragedy would be","The very thing to hear and see;","And for a piece of publication,","If I decline on this occasion,","It is not that I am not sensible","To merits in themselves ostensible,","But-and I grieve to speak it-plays","Are drugs-mere drugs, Sir, nowadays.","I had a heavy loss by","Manuel","-","Too lucky if it prove not annual-","And Sotheby, with his damn'd","Orestes","(Which, by the way, the old bore's best is),","Has lain so very long on hand","That I despair of all demand;","I've advertis'd-but see my books,","Or only watch my shopman's looks;","Still","Ivan",",","Ina","and such lumber","My back-shop glut, my shelves encumber.","There's Byron too, who once did better,","Has sent me-folded in a letter-","A sort of-it's no more a drama","Than","Darnley",",","Ivan","or","Kehama",":","So alter'd since last year his pen is,","I think he's lost his wits at Venice,","Or drain'd his brains away as stallion","To some dark-eyed and warm Italian;","In short, Sir, what with one and t'other,","I dare not venture on another.","I write in haste; excuse each blunder;","The coaches through the street so thunder!","My room's so full; we've Gifford here","Reading MSS with Hookham Frere,","Pronouncing on the nouns and particles","Of some of our forthcoming articles,","The","Quarterly","-ah, Sir, if you","Had but the genius to review!","A smart critique upon St. Helena,","Or if you only would but tell in a","Short compass what-but, to resume;","As I was saying, Sir, the room-","The room's so full of wits and bards,","Crabbes, Campbells, Crokers, Freres and Wards,","And others, neither bards nor wits-","My humble tenement admits","All persons in the dress of Gent.,","From Mr. Hammond to Dog Dent.","A party dines with me today,","All clever men who make their way:","Crabbe, Malcolm, Hamilton and Chantrey","Are all partakers of my pantry.","They're at this moment in discussion","On poor De Stael's late dissolution.","Her book, they say, was in advance-","Pray Heaven she tell the truth of France!","'Tis said she certainly was married","To Rocca, and had twice miscarried,","No-not miscarried, I opine-","But brought to bed at forty nine.","Some say she died a Papist; some","Are of opinion","that's","a hum;","I don't know that-the fellow, Schlegel,","Was very likely to inveigle","A dying person in compunction","To try the extremity of unction.","But peace be with her!

Among the ruined temples there,","Stupendous columns, and wild images","Of more than man, where marble daemons watch","The Zodiac's brazen mystery, and dead men","Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around,","He lingered, poring on memorials","Of the world's youth, through the long burning day","Gazed on those speechless shapes, nor, when the moon","Filled the mysterious halls with floating shades","Suspended he that task, but ever gazed","And gazed, till meaning on his vacant mind","Flashed like strong inspiration, and he saw","The thrilling secrets of the birth of time.","Meanwhile an Arab maiden brought his food,","Her daily portion, from her father's tent,","And spread her matting for his couch, and stole","From duties and repose to tend his steps:-","Enamoured, yet not daring for deep awe","To speak her love:-and watched his nightly sleep,","Sleepless herself, to gaze upon his lips","Parted in slumber, whence the regular breath","Of innocent dreams arose: then, when red morn","Made paler the pale moon, to her cold home","Wildered, and wan, and panting, she returned.","The Poet wandering on, through Arabie","And Persia, and the wild Carmanian waste,","And o'er the aerial mountains which pour down","Indus and Oxus from their icy caves,","In joy and exultation held his way;","Till in the vale of Cashmire, far within","Its loneliest dell, where odorous plants entwine","Beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower,","Beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched","His languid limbs. A vision on his sleep","There came, a dream of hopes that never yet","Had flushed his cheek. He dreamed a veiled maid","Sate near him, talking in low solemn tones.","Her voice was like the voice of his own soul","Heard in the calm of thought; its music long,","Like woven sounds of streams and breezes, held","His inmost sense suspended in its web","Of many-coloured woof and shifting hues.","Knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme,","And lofty hopes of divine liberty,","Thoughts the most dear to him, and poesy,","Herself a poet. Soon the solemn mood","Of her pure mind kindled through all her frame","A permeating fire: wild numbers then","She raised, with voice stifled in tremulous sobs","Subdued by its own pathos: her fair hands","Were bare alone, sweeping from some strange harp","Strange symphony, and in their branching veins","The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale.","The beating of her heart was heard to fill","The pauses of her music, and her breath","Tumultuously accorded with those fits","Of intermitted song. Sudden she rose,","As if her heart impatiently endured","Its bursting burthen: at the sound he turned,","And saw by the warm light of their own life","Her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil","Of woven wind, her outspread arms now bare,","Her dark locks floating in the breath of night,","Her beamy bending eyes, her parted lips","Outstretched, and pale, and quivering eagerly.","His strong heart sunk and sickened with excess","Of love. He reared his shuddering limbs and quelled","His gasping breath, and spread his arms to meet","Her panting bosom:...she drew back a while,","Then, yielding to the irresistible joy,","With frantic gesture and short breathless cry","Folded his frame in her dissolving arms.","Now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes, and night","Involved and swallowed up the vision; sleep,","Like a dark flood suspended in its course","Rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain.","Roused by the shock he started from his trance-","The cold white light of morning, the blue moon","Low in the west, the clear and garish hills,","The distinct valley and the vacant woods,","Spread round him where he stood. Whither have fled","The hues of heaven that canopied his bower","Of yesternight? The sounds that soothed his sleep,","The mystery and the majesty of Earth,","The joy, the exultation? His wan eyes","Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly","As ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven.","The spirit of sweet human love has sent","A vision to the sleep of him who spurned","Her choicest gifts. He eagerly pursues","Beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade;","He overleaps the bounds. Alas! Alas!","Were limbs and breath and being intertwined","Thus treacherously? Lost, lost, for ever lost,","In the wide pathless desert of dim sleep,","That beautiful shape! Does the dark gate of death","Conduct to thy mysterious paradise,","O Sleep? Does the bright arch of rainbow clouds,","And pendent mountains seen in the calm lake,","Lead only to a black and watery depth,","While death's blue vault, with loathliest vapours hung,","Where every shade which the foul grave exhales","Hides its dead eye from the detested day,","Conduct, O Sleep, to thy delightful realms?","This doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart,","The insatiate hope which it awakened stung","His brain even like despair.","While daylight held","The sky, the Poet kept mute conference","With his still soul. At night the passion came,","Like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream,","And shook him from his rest, and led him forth","Into the darkness.-As an eagle grasped","In folds of the green serpent, feels her breast","Burn with the poison, and precipitates","Through night and day, tempest, and calm, and cloud,","Frantic with dizzying anguish, her blind flight","O'er the wide aery wilderness: thus driven","By the bright shadow of that lovely dream,","Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night,","Through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells,","Startling with careless step the moonlight snake,","He fled. Red morning dawned upon his flight,","Shedding the mockery of its vital hues","Upon his cheek of death. He wandered on","Till vast Aornos, seen from Petra's steep,","Hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud;","Through Balk, and where the desolated tombs","Of Parthian kings scatter to every wind","Their wasting dust, wildly he wandered on,","Day after day a weary waste of hours,","Bearing within his life the brooding care","That ever fed on its decaying flame.","And now his limbs were lean; his scattered hair","Sered by the autumn of strange suffering","Sung dirges in the wind; his listless hand","Hung like dead bone within its withered skin;","Life, and the lustre that consumed it, shone","As in a furnace burning secretly","From his dark eyes alone. The cottagers,","Who ministered with human charity","His human wants, beheld with wondering awe","Their fleeting visitant. The mountaineer,","Encountering on some dizzy precipice","That spectral form, deemed that the Spirit of wind","With lightning eyes, and eager breath, and feet","Disturbing not the drifted snow, had paused","In its career: the infant would conceal","His troubled visage in his mother's robe","In terror at the glare of those wild eyes,","To remember their strange light in many a dream","Of after-times; but youthful maidens, taught","By nature, would interpret half the woe","That wasted him, would call him with false names","Brother, and friend, would press his pallid hand","At parting, and watch, dim through tears, the path","Of his departure from their father's door.","At length upon the lone Chorasmian shore","He paused, a wide and melancholy waste","Of putrid marshes. A strong impulse urged","His steps to the sea-shore. A swan was there,","Beside a sluggish stream among the reeds.","It rose as he approached, and with strong wings","Scaling the upward sky, bent its bright course","High over the immeasurable main.","His eyes pursued its flight.-\"Thou hast a home,","Beautiful bird; thou voyagest to thine home,","Where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck","With thine, and welcome thy return with eyes","Bright in the lustre of their own fond joy.","And what am I that I should linger here,","With voice far sweeter than thy dying notes,","Spirit more vast than thine, frame more attuned","To beauty, wasting these surpassing powers","In the deaf air, to the blind earth, and heaven","That echoes not my thoughts?\" A gloomy smile","Of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips.","For sleep, he knew, kept most relentlessly","Its precious charge, and silent death exposed,","Faithless perhaps as sleep, a shadowy lure,","With doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms.","Startled by his own thoughts he looked around.","There was no fair fiend near him, not a sight","Or sound of awe but in his own deep mind.","A little shallop floating near the shore","Caught the impatient wandering of his gaze.","It had been long abandoned, for its sides","Gaped wide with many a rift, and its frail joints","Swayed with the undulations of the tide.","A restless impulse urged him to embark","And meet lone Death on the drear ocean's waste;","For well he knew that mighty Shadow loves","The slimy caverns of the populous deep.","The day was fair and sunny: sea and sky","Drank its inspiring radiance, and the wind","Swept strongly from the shore, blackening the waves.","Following his eager soul, the wanderer","Leaped in the boat, he spread his cloak aloft","On the bare mast, and took his lonely seat,","And felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea","Like a torn cloud before the hurricane.","As one that in a silver vision floats","Obedient to the sweep of odorous winds","Upon resplendent clouds, so rapidly","Along the dark and ruffled waters fled","The straining boat.-A whirlwind swept it on,","With fierce gusts and precipitating force,","Through the white ridges of the chafed sea.","The waves arose. Higher and higher still","Their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge","Like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp.","Calm and rejoicing in the fearful war","Of wave ruining on wave, and blast on blast","Descending, and black flood on whirlpool driven","With dark obliterating course, he sate:","As if their genii were the ministers","Appointed to conduct him to the light","Of those beloved eyes, the Poet sate","Holding the steady helm. Evening came on,","The beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues","High 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray","That canopied his path o'er the waste deep;","Twilight, ascending slowly from the east,","Entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks","O'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day;","Night followed, clad with stars. On every side","More horribly the multitudinous streams","Of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war","Rushed in dark tumult thundering, as to mock","The calm and spangled sky. The little boat","Still fled before the storm; still fled, like foam","Down the steep cataract of a wintry river;","Now pausing on the edge of the riven wave;","Now leaving far behind the bursting mass","That fell, convulsing ocean. Safely fled-","As if that frail and wasted human form,","Had been an elemental god.","At midnight","The moon arose: and lo! the ethereal cliffs","Of Caucasus, whose icy summits shone","Among the stars like sunlight, and around","Whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves","Bursting and eddying irresistibly","Rage and resound for ever.-Who shall save?-","The boat fled on,-the boiling torrent drove,-","The crags closed round with black and jagged arms,","The shattered mountain overhung the sea,","And faster still, beyond all human speed,","Suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave,","The little boat was driven. A cavern there","Yawned, and amid its slant and winding depths","Ingulfed the rushing sea. The boat fled on","With unrelaxing speed.-\"Vision and Love!\"","The Poet cried aloud, \"I have beheld","The path of thy departure. Sleep and death","Shall not divide us long!\"","The boat pursued","The windings of the cavern. Daylight shone","At length upon that gloomy river's flow;","Now, where the fiercest war among the waves","Is calm, on the unfathomable stream","The boat moved slowly. Where the mountain, riven,","Exposed those black depths to the azure sky,","Ere yet the flood's enormous volume fell","Even to the base of Caucasus, with sound","That shook the everlasting rocks, the mass","Filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm;","Stair above stair the eddying waters rose,","Circling immeasurably fast, and laved","With alternating dash the gnarled roots","Of mighty trees, that stretched their giant arms","In darkness over it. I' the midst was left,","Reflecting, yet distorting every cloud,","A pool of treacherous and tremendous calm.","Seized by the sway of the ascending stream,","With dizzy swiftness, round, and round, and round,","Ridge after ridge the straining boat arose,","Till on the verge of the extremest curve,","Where, through an opening of the rocky bank,","The waters overflow, and a smooth spot","Of glassy quiet mid those battling tides","Is left, the boat paused shuddering.-Shall it sink","Down the abyss? Shall the reverting stress","Of that resistless gulf embosom it?","Now shall it fall?-A wandering stream of wind,","Breathed from the west, has caught the expanded sail,","And, lo! with gentle motion, between banks","Of mossy slope, and on a placid stream,","Beneath a woven grove it sails, and, hark!","The ghastly torrent mingles its far roar,","With the breeze murmuring in the musical woods.","Where the embowering trees recede, and leave","A little space of green expanse, the cove","Is closed by meeting banks, whose yellow flowers","For ever gaze on their own drooping eyes,","Reflected in the crystal calm. The wave","Of the boat's motion marred their pensive task,","Which nought but vagrant bird, or wanton wind,","Or falling spear-grass, or their own decay","Had e'er disturbed before. The Poet longed","To deck with their bright hues his withered hair,","But on his heart its solitude returned,","And he forbore. Not the strong impulse hid","In those flushed cheeks, bent eyes, and shadowy frame","Had yet performed its ministry: it hung","Upon his life, as lightning in a cloud","Gleams, hovering ere it vanish, ere the floods","Of night close over it.","The noonday sun","Now shone upon the forest, one vast mass","Of mingling shade, whose brown magnificence","A narrow vale embosoms. There, huge caves","Scooped in the dark base of their aery rocks","Mocking its moans, respond and roar for ever.","The meeting boughs and implicated leaves","Wove twilight o'er the Poet's path, as led","By love, or dream, or god, or mightier Death,","He sought in Nature's dearest haunt, some bank","Her cradle, and his sepulchre. More dark","And dark the shades accumulate. The oak,","Expanding its immense and knotty arms,","Embraces the light beech. The pyramids","Of the tall cedar overarching, frame","Most solemn domes within, and far below,","Like clouds suspended in an emerald sky,","The ash and the acacia floating hang","Tremulous and pale. Like restless serpents, clothed","In rainbow and in fire, the parasites,","Starred with ten thousand blossoms, flow around","The grey trunks, and, as gamesome infants' eyes,","With gentle meanings, and most innocent wiles,","Fold their beams round the hearts of those that love,","These twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs","Uniting their close union; the woven leaves","Make net-work of the dark blue light of day,","And the night's noontide clearness, mutable","As shapes in the weird clouds. Soft mossy lawns","Beneath these canopies extend their swells,","Fragrant with perfumed herbs, and eyed with blooms","Minute yet beautiful. One darkest glen","Sends from its woods of musk-rose, twined with jasmine,","A soul-dissolving odour, to invite","To some more lovely mystery. Through the dell,","Silence and Twilight here, twin-sisters, keep","Their noonday watch, and sail among the shades,","Like vaporous shapes half seen; beyond, a well,","Dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave,","Images all the woven boughs above,","And each depending leaf, and every speck","Of azure sky, darting between their chasms;","Nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves","Its portraiture, but some inconstant star","Between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair,","Or painted bird, sleeping beneath the moon,","Or gorgeous insect floating motionless,","Unconscious of the day, ere yet his wings","Have spread their glories to the gaze of noon.","Hither the Poet came. His eyes beheld","Their own wan light through the reflected lines","Of his thin hair, distinct in the dark depth","Of that still fountain; as the human heart,","Gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave,","Sees its own treacherous likeness there. He heard","The motion of the leaves, the grass that sprung","Startled and glanced and trembled even to feel","An unaccustomed presence, and the sound","Of the sweet brook that from the secret springs","Of that dark fountain rose. A Spirit seemed","To stand beside him-clothed in no bright robes","Of shadowy silver or enshrining light,","Borrowed from aught the visible world affords","Of grace, or majesty, or mystery;-","But, undulating woods, and silent well,","And leaping rivulet, and evening gloom","Now deepening the dark shades, for speech assuming,","Held commune with him, as if he and it","Were all that was,-only... when his regard","Was raised by intense pensiveness,... two eyes,","Two starry eyes, hung in the gloom of thought,","And seemed with their serene and azure smiles","To beckon him.","Obedient to the light","That shone within his soul, he went, pursuing","The windings of the dell.-The rivulet","Wanton and wild, through many a green ravine","Beneath the forest flowed. Sometimes it fell","Among the moss, with hollow harmony","Dark and profound. Now on the polished stones","It danced; like childhood laughing as it went:","Then, through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept,","Reflecting every herb and drooping bud","That overhung its quietness.-\"O stream!","Whose source is inaccessibly profound,","Whither do thy mysterious waters tend?","Thou imagest my life. Thy darksome stillness,","Thy dazzling waves, thy loud and hollow gulfs,","Thy searchless fountain, and invisible course","Have each their type in me: and the wide sky,","And measureless ocean may declare as soon","What oozy cavern or what wandering cloud","Contains thy waters, as the universe","Tell where these living thoughts reside, when stretched","Upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste","I' the passing wind!\"","Beside the grassy shore","Of the small stream he went; he did impress","On the green moss his tremulous step, that caught","Strong shuddering from his burning limbs. As one","Roused by some joyous madness from the couch","Of fever, he did move; yet, not like him,","Forgetful of the grave, where, when the flame","Of his frail exultation shall be spent,","He must descend. With rapid steps he went","Beneath the shade of trees, beside the flow","Of the wild babbling rivulet; and now","The forest's solemn canopies were changed","For the uniform and lightsome evening sky.","Grey rocks did peep from the spare moss, and stemmed","The struggling brook: tall spires of windlestrae","Threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope,","And nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines","Branchless and blasted, clenched with grasping roots","The unwilling soil. A gradual change was here,","Yet ghastly. For, as fast years flow away,","The smooth brow gathers, and the hair grows thin","And white, and where irradiate dewy eyes","Had shone, gleam stony orbs:-so from his steps","Bright flowers departed, and the beautiful shade","Of the green groves, with all their odorous winds","And musical motions. Calm, he still pursued","The stream, that with a larger volume now","Rolled through the labyrinthine dell; and there","Fretted a path through its descending curves","With its wintry speed. On every side now rose","Rocks, which, in unimaginable forms,","Lifted their black and barren pinnacles","In the light of evening, and its precipice","Obscuring the ravine, disclosed above,","Mid toppling stones, black gulfs and yawning caves,","Whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues","To the loud stream. Lo! where the pass expands","Its stony jaws, the abrupt mountain breaks,","And seems, with its accumulated crags,","To overhang the world: for wide expand","Beneath the wan stars and descending moon","Islanded seas, blue mountains, mighty streams,","Dim tracts and vast, robed in the lustrous gloom","Of leaden-coloured even, and fiery hills","Mingling their flames with twilight, on the verge","Of the remote horizon. The near scene,","In naked and severe simplicity,","Made contrast with the universe. A pine,","Rock-rooted, stretched athwart the vacancy","Its swinging boughs, to each inconstant blast","Yielding one only response, at each pause,","In most familiar cadence, with the howl","The thunder and the hiss of homeless streams","Mingling its solemn song, whilst the broad river,","Foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path,","Fell into that immeasurable void,","Scattering its waters to the passing winds.","Yet the grey precipice and solemn pine","And torrent, were not all;-one silent nook","Was there. Even on the edge of that vast mountain,","Upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks,","It overlooked in its serenity","The dark earth, and the bending vault of stars.","It was a tranquil spot, that seemed to smile","Even in the lap of horror. Ivy clasped","The fissured stones with its entwining arms,","And did embower with leaves for ever green,","And berries dark, the smooth and even space","Of its inviolated floor, and here","The children of the autumnal whirlwind bore,","In wanton sport, those bright leaves, whose decay,","Red, yellow, or ethereally pale,","Rivals the pride of summer. 'Tis the haunt","Of every gentle wind, whose breath can teach","The wilds to love tranquillity. One step,","One human step alone, has ever broken","The stillness of its solitude:-one voice","Alone inspired its echoes;-even that voice","Which hither came, floating among the winds,","And led the loveliest among human forms","To make their wild haunts the depository","Of all the grace and beauty that endued","Its motions, render up its majesty,","Scatter its music on the unfeeling storm,","And to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould,","Nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss,","Commit the colours of that varying cheek,","That snowy breast, those dark and drooping eyes.","The dim and horned moon hung low, and poured","A sea of lustre on the horizon's verge","That overflowed its mountains. Yellow mist","Filled the unbounded atmosphere, and drank","Wan moonlight even to fulness: not a star","Shone, not a sound was heard; the very winds,","Danger's grim playmates, on that precipice","Slept, clasped in his embrace.-O, storm of death!","Whose sightless speed divides this sullen night:","And thou, colossal Skeleton, that, still","Guiding its irresistible career","In thy devastating omnipotence,","Art king of this frail world, from the red field","Of slaughter, from the reeking hospital,","The patriot's sacred couch, the snowy bed","Of innocence, the scaffold and the throne,","A mighty voice invokes thee. Ruin calls","His brother Death. A rare and regal prey","He hath prepared, prowling around the world;","Glutted with which thou mayst repose, and men","Go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms,","Nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine","The unheeded tribute of a broken heart.","When on the threshold of the green recess","The wanderer's footsteps fell, he knew that death","Was on him. Yet a little, ere it fled,","Did he resign his high and holy soul","To images of the majestic past,","That paused within his passive being now,","Like winds that bear sweet music, when they breathe","Through some dim latticed chamber. He did place","His pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk","Of the old pine. Upon an ivied stone","Reclined his languid head, his limbs did rest,","Diffused and motionless, on the smooth brink","Of that obscurest chasm;-and thus he lay,","Surrendering to their final impulses","The hovering powers of life. Hope and despair,","The torturers, slept; no mortal pain or fear","Marred his repose, the influxes of sense,","And his own being unalloyed by pain,","Yet feebler and more feeble, calmly fed","The stream of thought, till he lay breathing there","At peace, and faintly smiling:-his last sight","Was the great moon, which o'er the western line","Of the wide world her mighty horn suspended,","With whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed","To mingle. Now upon the jagged hills","It rests, and still as the divided frame","Of the vast meteor sunk, the Poet's blood,","That ever beat in mystic sympathy","With nature's ebb and flow, grew feebler still:","And when two lessening points of light alone","Gleamed through the darkness, the alternate gasp","Of his faint respiration scarce did stir","The stagnate night:-till the minutest ray","Was quenched, the pulse yet lingered in his heart.","It paused-it fluttered. But when heaven remained","Utterly black, the murky shades involved","An image, silent, cold, and motionless,","As their own voiceless earth and vacant air.","Even as a vapour fed with golden beams","That ministered on sunlight, ere the west","Eclipses it, was now that wondrous frame-","No sense, no motion, no divinity-","A fragile lute, on whose harmonious strings","The breath of heaven did wander-a bright stream","Once fed with many-voiced waves-a dream","Of youth, which night and time have quenched for ever,","Still, dark, and dry, and unremembered now.","O, for Medea's wondrous alchemy,","Which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam","With bright flowers, and the wintry boughs exhale","From vernal blooms fresh fragrance! O, that God,","Profuse of poisons, would concede the chalice","Which but one living man has drained, who now,","Vessel of deathless wrath, a slave that feels","No proud exemption in the blighting curse","He bears, over the world wanders for ever,","Lone as incarnate death! O, that the dream","Of dark magician in his visioned cave,","Raking the cinders of a crucible","For life and power, even when his feeble hand","Shakes in its last decay, were the true law","Of this so lovely world! But thou art fled","Like some frail exhalation; which the dawn","Robes in its golden beams,-ah! thou hast fled!","The brave, the gentle, and the beautiful,","The child of grace and genius. Heartless things","Are done and said i' the world, and many worms","And beasts and men live on, and mighty Earth","From sea and mountain, city and wilderness,","In vesper low or joyous orison,","Lifts still its solemn voice:-but thou art fled-","Thou canst no longer know or love the shapes","Of this phantasmal scene, who have to thee","Been purest ministers, who are, alas!","Now thou art not. Upon those pallid lips","So sweet even in their silence, on those eyes","That image sleep in death, upon that form","Yet safe from the worm's outrage, let no tear","Be shed-not even in thought.

hour of languor, finds at last;","What forms the real picture of the poor,","Demands a song-the Muse can give no more.","Fled are those times, if e'er such times were seen,","When rustic poets praised their native green;","No shepherds now, in smooth alternate verse,","Their country's beauty or their nymphs' rehearse;","Yet still for these we frame the tender strain,","Still in our lays fond Corydons complain,","And shepherds' boys their amorous pains reveal,","The only pains, alas! they never feel.","On Mincio's banks, in Caesar's bounteous reign,","If Tityrus found the Golden Age again,","Must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong,","Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song?","From truth and nature shall we widely stray,","Where Virgil, not where Fancy, leads the way?","Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy swains,","Because the Muses never knew their pains.","They boast their peasants' pipes, but peasants now","Resign their pipes and plod behind the plough;","And few amid the rural tribe have time","To number syllables and play with rhyme;","Save honest Duck, what son of verse could share","The poet's rapture and the peasant's care?","Or the great labours of the field degrade","With the new peril of a poorer trade?","From one chief cause these idle praises spring,","That themes so easy few forbear to sing;","They ask no thought, require no deep design,","But swell the song and liquefy the line;","The gentle lover takes the rural strain,","A nymph his mistress and himself a swain;","With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer,","But all, to look like her, is painted fair.","I grant indeed that fields and flocks have charms","For him that gazes or for him that farms;","But when amid such pleasing scenes I trace","The poor laborious natives of the place,","And see the mid-day sun, with fervid ray,","On their bare heads and dewy temples play;","While some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts,","Deplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts:","Then shall I dare these real ills to hide","In tinsel trappings of poetic pride?","No, cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,","Which can no groves nor happy valleys boast;","Where other cares than those the Muse relates,","And other shepherds dwell with other mates;","By such examples taught, I paint the cot,","As truth will paint it, and as bards will not:","Nor you, ye poor, of lettered scorn complain,","To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;","O'ercome by labour and bowed down by time,","Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme?","Can poets soothe you, when you pine for bread,","By winding myrtles round your ruined shed?","Can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower,","Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?","Lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o'er,","Lends the light turf that warms the neighboring poor;","From thence a length of burning sand appears,","Where the thin harvest waves its withered ears;","Rank weeds, that every art and care defy,","Reign o'er the land and rob the blighted rye:","There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,","And to the ragged infant threaten war;","There poppies, nodding, mock the hope of toil,","There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil;","Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf,","The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf;","O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade,","And the wild tare clings round the sickly blade;","With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,","And a sad splendor vainly shines around.","So looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn,","Betrayed by man, then left for man to scorn;","Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic rose","While her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose;","Whose outward splendour is but folly's dress,","Exposing most, when most it gilds distress.","Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race,","With sullen woe displayed in every face;","Who far from civil arts and social fly,","And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.","Here too the lawless merchant of the main","Draws from his plough th' intoxicated swain;","Want only claimed the labor of the day,","But vice now steals his nightly rest away.","Where are the swains, who, daily labor done,","With rural games played down the setting sun;","Who struck with matchless force the bounding ball,","Or made the pond'rous quoit obliquely fall;","While some huge Ajax, terrible and strong,","Engaged some artful stripling of the throng,","And, foiled, beneath the young Ulysses fell,","When peals of praise the merry mischief tell?","Where now are these?-Beneath yon cliff they stand,","To show the freighted pinnace where to land;","To load the ready steed with guilty haste;","To fly in terror o'er the pathless waste,","Or, when detected in their straggling course,","To foil their foes by cunning or by force;","Or, yielding part (when equal knaves contest),","To gain a lawless passport for the rest.","Here, wand'ring long amid these frowning fields,","I sought the simple life that Nature yields;","Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurped her place,","And a bold, artful, surly, savage race;","Who, only skilled to take the finny tribe,","The yearly dinner, or septennial bribe","Wait on the shore and, as the waves run high,","On the tossed vessel bend their eager eye,","Which to their coast directs its vent'rous way,","Theirs, or the ocean's, miserable prey.","As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand,","And wait for favoring winds to leave the land;","While still for flight the ready wing is spread:","So waited I the favouring hour, and fled;","Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign,","And cried, Ah! hapless they who still remain;","Who still remain to hear the ocean roar,","Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore;","Till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway,","Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away;","When the sad tenant weeps from door to door,","And begs a poor protection from the poor!","But these are scenes where Nature's niggard hand","Gave a spare portion to the famished land;","Hers is the fault, if here mankind complain","Of fruitless toil and labor spent in vain;","But yet in other scenes, more fair in view,","Where Plenty smiles-alas! she smiles for few","And those who taste not, yet behold her store,","Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore,","The wealth around them makes them doubly poor.","Or will you deem them amply paid in health,","Labor's fair child, that languishes with wealth?","Go then! and see them rising with the sun,","Through a long course of daily toil to run;","Like him to make the plenteous harvest grow,","And yet not shard the plenty they bestow;","See them beneath the dog-star's raging heat,","When the knees tremble and the temples beat;","Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o'er","The labour past, and toils to come explore;","See them alternate suns and showers engage,","And hoard up aches and anguish for their age;","Through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue,","When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew;","Then own that labour may as fatal be","To these thy slaves, as luxury to thee.","Amid this tribe too oft a manly pride","Strives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide;","There may you see the youth of slender frame","Contend with weakness, weariness, and shame:","Yet urged along, and proudly loth to yield,","He strives to join his fellows of the field;","Till long-contending nature droops at last,","Declining health rejects his poor repast,","His cheerless spouse the coming danger sees,","And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.","Yet grant them health, 'tis not for us to tell,","Though the head droops not, that the heart is well;","Or will you urge their homely, plenteous fare,","Healthy and plain and still the poor man's share!","Oh! trifle not with wants you cannot feel,","Nor mock the misery of a stinted meal;","Homely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, such","As you who envy would disdain to touch.","Ye gentle souls, who dream of rural ease,","Whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please;","Go! if the peaceful cot your praises share,","Go, look within, and ask if peace be there:","If peace be his-that drooping weary sire,","Or theirs, that offspring round their feeble fire,","Or hers, that matron pale, whose trembling hand","Turns on the wretched hearth th' expiring brand.","Nor yet can time itself obtain for these","Life's latest comforts, due respect and ease;","For yonder see that hoary swain, whose age","Can with no cares except his own engage;","Who, propped on that rude staff, looks up to see","The bare arms broken from the withering tree,","On which, a boy, he climbed the loftiest bough,","Then his first joy, but his sad emblem now.","He once was chief in all the rustic trade,","His steady hand the straightest furrow made;","Full many a prize he won, and still is proud","To find the triumphs of his youth allowed.","A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes,","He hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs:","For now he journeys to his grave in pain;","The rich disdain him, nay, the poor disdain;","Alternate masters now their slave command,","And urge the efforts of his feeble hand;","Who, when his age attempts its task in vain,","With ruthless taunts of lazy poor complain.","Oft may you see him, when he tends the sheep,","His winter-charge, beneath the hillock weep;","Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blow","O'er his white locks and bury them in snow;","When, roused by rage and muttering in the morn,","He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn:","\"Why do I live, when I desire to be","At once from life and life's long labour free?","Like leaves in spring, the young are blown away,","Without the sorrows of a slow decay;","I, like yon withered leaf, remain behind,","Nipped by the frost, and shivering in the wind;","There it abides till younger buds come on,","As I, now all my fellow-swains are gone;","Then, from the rising generation thrust,","It falls, like me, unnoticed to the dust.","\"These fruitful fields, these numerous flocks I see,","Are others' gain, but killing cares to me;","To me the children of my youth are lords,","Slow in their gifts but hasty in their words:","Wants of their own demand their care, and who","Feels his own want and succors others too?","A lonely, wretched man, in pain I go,","None need my help and none relieve my woe;","Then let my bones beneath the turf be laid,","And men forget the wretch they would not aid.\"","Thus groan the old, till, by disease oppressed,","They taste a final woe, and then they rest.","Theirs is yon house that holds the parish poor,","Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;","There, where the putrid vapours, flagging, play,","And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day;","There children dwell, who know no parents' care,","Parents, who know no children's love, dwell there;","Heart-broken matrons on their joyless bed,","Forsaken wives, and mothers never wed;","Dejected widows with unheeded tears,","And crippled age with more than childhood-fears;","The lame, the blind, and, far the happiest they!","The moping idiot and the madman gay.","Here too the sick their final doom receive,","Here brought, amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,","Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,","Mixed with the clamors of the crowd below;","Here, sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,","And the cold charities of man to man:","Whose laws indeed for ruined age provide,","And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;","But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,","And pride embitters what it can't deny.","Say ye, oppressed by some fantastic woes,","Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose;","Who press the downy couch, while slaves advance","With timid eye to read the distant glance;","Who with sad prayers the weary doctor tease","To name the nameless ever-new disease;","Who with mock patience dire complaints endure,","Which real pain, and that alone, can cure;","How would ye bear in real pain to lie,","Despised, neglected, left alone to die?","How would ye bear to draw your latest breath,","Where all that's wretched paves the way for death?","Such is that room which one rude beam divides,","And naked rafters form the sloping sides;","Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen,","And lath and mud is all that lie between;","Save one dull pane, that, coarsely patched, gives way","To the rude tempest, yet excludes the day.","Here, on a matted flock, with dust o'erspread,","The drooping wretch reclines his languid head;","For him no hand the cordial cup applies,","Nor wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes;","No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile,","Nor promise hope till sickness wears a smile.","But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,","Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls.","Anon, a figure enters, quaintly neat,","All pride and business, bustle and conceit;","With looks unaltered by these scenes of woe,","With speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go,","He bids the gazing throng around him fly,","And carries fate and physic in his eye;","A potent quack, long versed in human ills,","Who first insults the victim whom he kills;","Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy bench protect,","And whose most tender mercy is neglect.","Paid by the parish for attendance here,","He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer;","In haste he seeks the bed where misery lies,","Impatience marked in his averted eyes;","And, some habitual queries hurried o'er,","Without reply, he rushes on the door:","His drooping patient, long inured to pain,","And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;","He ceases now the feeble help to crave","Of man, and mutely hastens to the grave.","But ere his death some pious doubts arise,","Some simple fears, which \"bold bad\" men despise;","Fain would he ask the parish priest to prove","His title certain to the joys above;","For this he sends the murmuring nurse, who calls","The holy stranger to these dismal walls;","And doth not he, the pious man, appear,","He, \"passing rich with forty pounds a year\"?","Ah! no; a shepherd of a different stock,","And far unlike him, feeds this little flock:","A jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday's task","As much as God or man can fairly ask;","The rest he gives to loves and labors light,","To fields the morning and to feasts the night;","None better skilled the noisy pack to guide,","To urge their chase, to cheer them or to chide;","Sure in his shot, his game he seldom missed,","And seldom failed to win his game at whist;","Then, while such honors bloom around his head,","Shall he sit sadly by the sick man's bed","To raise the hope he feels not, or with zeal","To combat fears that ev'n the pious feel","Now once again the gloomy scene explore,","Less gloomy now; the bitter hour is o'er,","The man of many sorrows sighs no more.","Up yonder hill, behold how sadly slow","The bier moves winding from the vale below;","There lie the happy dead, from trouble free,","And the glad parish pays the frugal fee.","No more, oh Death! thy victim starts to hear","Churchwarden stern, or kingly overseer;","No more the farmer gets his humble bow,","Thou art his lord, the best of tyrants thou!","Now to the church behold the mourners come,","Sedately torpid and devoutly dumb;","The village children now their games suspend,","To see the bier that bears their ancient friend:","For he was one in all their idle sport,","And like a monarch ruled their little court;","The pliant bow he formed, the flying ball,","The bat, the wicket, were his labours all;","Him now they follow to his grave, and stand","Silent and sad, and gazing, hand in hand;","While bending low, their eager eyes explore","The mingled relics of the parish poor.","The bell tolls late, the moping owl flies round,","Fear marks the flight and magnifies the sound;","The busy priest, detained by weightier care,","Defers his duty till the day of prayer;","And, waiting long, the crowd retire distressed,","To think a poor man's bones should lie unblessed."]},"097949d8c9e6c736be01355b9a30a4ea":{"url":"www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43822/and-thou-art-dead-as-young-and-fair","title":"And Thou art Dead, as Young and Fair","author":"Lord Byron

shed,","To think I was not near to keep","One vigil o'er thy bed;","To gaze, how fondly! on thy face,","To fold thee in a faint embrace,","Uphold thy drooping head;","And show that love, however vain,","Nor thou nor I can feel again.","Yet how much less it were to gain,","Though thou hast left me free,","The loveliest things that still remain,","Than thus remember thee!","The all of thine that cannot die","Through dark and dread Eternity","Returns again to me,","And more thy buried love endears","Than aught except its living years."]},"af0f968e6160003e4fbe9630ce270513":{"url":"www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44986/january-1795","title":"January, 1795","author":"Mary Robinson","poem":["Pavement slipp'ry, people sneezing,","Lords in ermine, beggars freezing;","Titled gluttons dainties carving,","Genius in a garret starving.","Lofty mansions, warm and spacious;","Courtiers cringing and voracious;","Misers scarce the wretched heeding;","Gallant soldiers fighting, bleeding.","Wives who laugh at passive spouses;","Theatres, and meeting-houses;","Balls, where simp'ring misses languish;","Hospitals, and groans of anguish.","Arts and sciences bewailing;","Commerce drooping, credit failing;","Placemen mocking subjects loyal;","Separations, weddings royal.","Authors who can't earn a dinner;","Many a subtle rogue a winner;","Fugitives for shelter seeking;","Misers hoarding, tradesmen breaking.","Taste and talents quite deserted;","All the laws of truth perverted;","Arrogance o'er merit soaring;","Merit silently deploring.","Ladies gambling night and morning;","Fools the works of genius scorning;","Ancient dames for girls mistaken,","Youthful damsels quite forsaken.","Some in luxury delighting;","More in talking than in fighting;","Lovers old, and beaux decrepid;","Lordlings empty and insipid.","Poets, painters, and musicians;","Lawyers, doctors, politicians:","Pamphlets, newspapers, and odes,","Seeking fame by diff'rent roads.","Gallant souls with empty purses;","Gen'rals only fit for nurses;","School-boys, smit with martial spirit,","Taking place of vet'ran merit.","Honest men who can't get places,","Knaves who shew unblushing faces;","Ruin hasten'd, peace retarded;","Candor spurn'd, and art rewarded."]},"e265aa18bef640aaee5d34b3caf695b2":{"url":"www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51935/to-wordsworth","title":"To Wordsworth","author":"Felicia Dorothea Hemans","poem":["There is a strain to read among the hills,","The old and full of voices - by the source","Of some free stream, whose gladdening presence fills","The solitude with sound; for in its course","Even such is thy deep song, that seems a part","Of those high scences, a fountain from the heart.","Or its calm spirit fitly may be taken","To the still breast in sunny garden bowers,","Where vernal winds each tree's low tones awaken,","And bud and bell with changes mark the hours.","There let thy thoughts be with me, while the day","Sinks with a golden and serene decay.","Or by some hearth where happy faces meet,","When night hath hushed the woods, with all their birds,","There, from some gentle voice, that lay were sweet","As antique music, linked with household words;","While in pleased murmurs woman's lip might move,","And the raised eye of childhood shine in love.","Or where the shadows of dark solemn yews","Brood silently o'er some lone burial-ground,","Thy verse hath power that brightly might diffuse","A breath, a kindling, as of spring, around;","From its own glow of hope and courage high,","And steadfast faith's victorious constancy.","True bard and holy! - thou art e'en as one","Who, by some secret gift of soul or eye,","In every spot beneath the smiling sun,","Sees where the springs of living waters lie;","Unseen awhile they sleep - till, touched by thee,","Bright healthful waves flow forth, to each glad wanderer free."]}}
